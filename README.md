# Camino: Mozilla for Power Macintosh

A fork of Firefox to maintain support for the Power Mac, supporting Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5, with special features and optimizations for PowerPC processors and AltiVec. _This project is not affiliated with nor supported by Mozilla in any way, and is not an official build._ **PowerPC forever!**

This project is specifically for Mac OS X 10.4+. If you're looking for a browser for Mac OS 8.6-10.3, look at our sister project, [Classilla](http://www.classilla.org/).

**If you are an end-user, or otherwise not an official contributor, please do file issues on Github.** 

The `wiki/` branch contains old documentation and release notes from our former Google Code wiki. They are no longer updated or maintained. Take care as links in those documents have probably rotted.
